### Projects
- Project 1: [Movie Trailer Website](https://github.com/mpvanveldhuizen/udacity/tree/master/movie-trailer-website) (`movie-trailer-website`): Where I wrote server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. I then served this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

- Project 2: [Tournoment Results](https://github.com/mpvanveldhuizen/udacity/tree/master/tournament-results) (`tournament-results`): Where I developed a database schema to store the game matches between players. I then wrote code to query this data and determine the winners of various games.

- Project 3: [Item Catalog](https://github.com/mpvanveldhuizen/udacity/tree/master/catalog) (`catalog`): Where I developed an application that provides a list of items (in my case Books) within a variety of categories (in my case Authros) as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

- Project 4: [Conference Organization App](https://github.com/mpvanveldhuizen/udacity/tree/master/conference-organization-app) (`conference-organization-app`): I developed a cloud-based API server to support a provided conference organization application that exists on the web as well as a native Android application. The API supports the following functionality found within the app: user authentication, user profiles, conference information and various manners in which to query the data.

- (TODO) Project 5: Linux Server Configuration: Where I took a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.
