# Movie Trailer Website Project
### About
This is the first project from the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. Where I wrote server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. I then served this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

### Setup Instructions
